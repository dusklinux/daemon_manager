# Daemon Manager

SwiftUI service/preset manager for jailbroken iOS 16+, built with XcodeGen and installed with TrollStore Lite or AppSync Unified.

Tap a service name or chevron for its known description, launchd plist and executable paths, and related file metadata where verified. Contacts-related services show the address-book database paths, sizes, and modification dates without reading contact records. Uncertain private roles are omitted. The independent switch edits the saved launchd override; restart userspace for full loaded-process changes.

The tab bar has an opaque standard and scroll-edge appearance from initial launch. RAM is labeled **free + speculative** in MiB, rather than implying it is physical free RAM.

`daemon.cfg` matches all 504 builtin targets: **324 off, 180 on**. `yes` = disabled override; `no` = enabled override. All entries remain manually configurable. Existing critical warnings are retained; the following additional red **KEEP ENABLED** recommendations reflect a 2026-10-11 iPhone 8 Plus test:

- `searchd`: repeated Photos Spotlight retries and sustained CPU during broad live unloading; fresh boot and a short single-service comparison did not reproduce it, so causality remains unproven.
- `biomed`: SpringBoard/keyboard Biome metadata and lockfile errors with the service off.
- `syncdefaultsd`: provides `com.apple.kvsd`; multiple clients logged failed synchronized key-value-store access with it off.
- `mobile.lockdown`: paired USB tools failed when disabled and worked after restoration; keep enabled for pairing/computer backups.

These recommendations do not claim new bootloop risks. The earlier full-off profile passed user-confirmed basic usage after reboot, but logs were not clean and the >600 MiB physical-free idle target was not established. No broad performance or battery-life gain is claimed.

Custom target choices are stored separately from builtins. Legacy full-copy preferences migrate values differing from the old builtins as custom choices; inherited values adopt revised defaults. The old format cannot distinguish a deliberate choice equal to an inherited value.

Routine single and batch actions use and verify native launchctl overrides, preserve root:wheel `0644` metadata for the tested persistence workflow, and report failures. They do not rewrite the launchd database directly or hot-unload dependencies. Restart userspace to apply process changes fully.

## Build

On macOS with Xcode, XcodeGen, and ldid:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project DaemonApp.xcodeproj -scheme DaemonApp -configuration Release -sdk iphoneos -derivedDataPath build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

The GitHub Actions workflow builds and packages `DaemonApp.ipa`, embeds `DaemonManagerSourceCommit` in its Info.plist, uploads an artifact, and publishes the versioned release. Check the intended commit's successful run and the embedded revision before installing; do not assume a mutable release asset belongs to a particular source revision.

The app's embedded Python is compatible with the **Python 3.9.9** runtime verified on the target phone. Tests cover preset drift, critical defaults, rejected commands, verification mismatches, and timeouts. UIKit/SwiftUI compilation and device visuals require the macOS build and physical-phone verification.

## Install

Transfer the IPA to the phone using its current SSH address. On the tested rootless installation:

```sh
/var/jb/Applications/TrollStoreLite.app/trollstorehelper install force /path/to/DaemonApp.ipa
```

Discover the helper path on other installations. `appinst /path/to/DaemonApp.ipa` with AppSync Unified is an alternative. Neither installation nor launching the app automatically applies the presets. The emergency launchd reset resets overrides and needs a userspace restart; it is not an exact restoration of an earlier configuration.
