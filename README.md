# Daemon Manager

SwiftUI service/preset manager for jailbroken iOS 16+, built with XcodeGen and installed with TrollStore Lite or AppSync Unified.

Tap a service name or chevron for its known description, launchd plist and executable paths, and related file metadata where verified. Contacts-related services show the address-book database paths, sizes, and modification dates without reading contact records. Uncertain private roles are omitted. The independent switch edits the saved launchd override; restart userspace for full loaded-process changes.

The tab bar has an opaque standard and scroll-edge appearance from initial launch. RAM displays only the value and unit, for example **365 MiB**. The header is kernel free memory including speculative pages, with each page counted once. Tap it for a live memory sheet.

`daemon.cfg` matches all 505 builtin targets: **320 off, 184 on**. `yes` = disabled override; `no` = enabled override. All entries remain manually configurable. Existing critical warnings are retained; the following orange **RECOMMENDED ON** recommendations reflect a 2026-10-11 iPhone 8 Plus test:

- `searchd`: repeated Photos Spotlight retries and sustained CPU during broad live unloading; fresh boot and a short single-service comparison did not reproduce it, so causality remains unproven.
- `biomed`: SpringBoard/keyboard Biome metadata and lockfile errors with the service off.
- `syncdefaultsd`: provides `com.apple.kvsd`; multiple clients logged failed synchronized key-value-store access with it off.
- `imagent` and `identityservicesd`: keep enabled for Messages/iMessage/FaceTime.
- `nehelper` (plist filename alias `nehelper-embedded`): required by Identity Services to create its network interface. Its absence caused repeated identityservicesd aborts and a black Messages screen; enabling it restored conversations. It also serves other Network Extension clients.
- `mobile.lockdown`: paired USB tools failed when disabled and worked after restoration; keep enabled for pairing/computer backups.

These recommendations do not claim new bootloop risks. The earlier full-off profile passed user-confirmed basic usage after reboot, but logs were not clean and the >600 MiB physical-free idle target was not established. No broad performance or battery-life gain is claimed.

Custom target choices are stored separately from builtins. Legacy full-copy preferences migrate values differing from the old builtins as custom choices; inherited values adopt revised defaults. The old format cannot distinguish a deliberate choice equal to an inherited value.

Routine single and batch actions use and verify native launchctl overrides, preserve root:wheel `0644` metadata for the tested persistence workflow, and report failures. They do not rewrite the launchd database directly or hot-unload dependencies. Restart userspace to apply process changes fully.

## Build

On macOS with Xcode, XcodeGen, and ldid:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project DaemonApp.xcodeproj -scheme DaemonApp -configuration Release -sdk iphoneos -derivedDataPath build CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

The GitHub Actions workflow builds and packages `DaemonApp.ipa`, embeds `DaemonManagerSourceCommit` in its Info.plist, uploads an artifact, and publishes the versioned release. Check the intended commit's successful run and the embedded revision before installing; do not assume a mutable release asset belongs to a particular source revision.

The app's embedded Python is compatible with the **Python 3.9.9** runtime verified on the target phone. Tests cover preset drift, critical defaults, rejected commands, verification mismatches, and timeouts. UIKit/SwiftUI compilation and device visuals require the macOS build and physical-phone verification.

## Install

Transfer the IPA to the phone using its current SSH address. On the tested rootless installation:

```sh
/var/jb/Applications/TrollStoreLite.app/trollstorehelper install force /path/to/DaemonApp.ipa
```

Discover the helper path on other installations. `appinst /path/to/DaemonApp.ipa` with AppSync Unified is an alternative. Neither installation nor launching the app automatically applies the presets. The emergency launchd reset resets overrides and needs a userspace restart; it is not an exact restoration of an earlier configuration.

## Service categories

**Critical** has a dedicated tab containing the installed services from the existing capital-`NO` classification, with disabled entries first. Membership is independent of override state; turning a critical service off never removes it from this category. Each description identifies the particular core functionality or stability risk; this category does not imply every service has a verified bootloop risk. Critical disables retain the existing confirmation, including when changing a default target.

**Recommended On** services have orange guidance and toggle directly without the critical confirmation. Messages dependencies are recommendations, not newly classified bootloop services. Their explanations document feature and dependency consequences, including repeated Identity Services crashes if nehelper is disabled while Identity Services is enabled.

All 505 targets are compiled into the IPA. Defaults shows installed services plus missing builtin entries, clearly marked "Not found on this device"; applying targets acts only on installed services. Custom choices override the builtin targets. No config import is needed on a fresh installation; optional import/export remains available. Installation itself does not apply defaults or change the phone's saved overrides.

## Memory and list organization

Services groups non-critical entries first and critical entries at the bottom under every filter, including On. The separate Critical tab still retains its disabled-first ordering.

Tap the RAM indicator for system pressure, physical RAM, physical free, speculative, active/inactive/wired, purgeable, file-backed/anonymous memory, and compression statistics. Compressed occupancy is the physical RAM used by the compressor; original stored-page size and their ratio are shown separately. Overlapping categories are not additive. Values refresh on the existing two-second timer; failed reads show unavailable values.

The old header added speculative pages twice: XNU's `free_count` already includes them. It now displays `free_count`, while physical free is `free_count - speculative_count`. This corrects accounting and does not represent a performance change. See [Apple's iOS 16 kernel implementation](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/xnu-8796.141.3/osfmk/kern/host.c) and [VM counter definitions](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/xnu-8796.141.3/osfmk/mach/vm_statistics.h).

Pressure uses [Dispatch memory-pressure events](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchsource/makememorypressuresource%28eventmask%3Aqueue%3A%29), seeded on opening/refresh by `kern.memorystatus_vm_pressure_level`. The current sysctl requires privilege on the tested iOS 16 phone, so the existing root credential is used once when needed. This is not periodic privileged polling. Returned flags are Normal=1, Warning=2, Critical=4; [the kernel exports dispatch flags, not its internal enum](https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/xnu-8796.141.3/bsd/kern/kern_memorystatus_notify.c). Unknown readings stay unknown; no pressure percentage is fabricated. The header color reflects the reported pressure instead of hardcoded free-RAM thresholds. Opening memory details never changes a daemon override.

## Wallpaper host and storage (v1.0.4)

The verified PosterBoard job is `/System/Library/LaunchAngels/com.apple.PosterBoard.plist`, label `com.apple.PosterBoard`, domain `user/501` on this phone (the app discovers the mobile UID). Killing its PID does not save an override. Native disable plus bootout stopped it and most associated poster extensions in the observed window. Basic UI checks and reboot persistence require separate verification. The app exposes this specific job under Tools → Wallpaper process and in Services; it does not expose other untested LaunchAngels such as input/UI hosts. The compiled default keeps it enabled for other users; manual disabling remains available, and userspace restart fully applies it. No auto-kill daemon, polling loop, file renaming, or arbitrary app blacklist is installed.

Speculative pages are reclaimable kernel filesystem cache, not a separately disableable SysMain service. Disabling predictive daemons does not eliminate all speculative pages. No useful verified force-compress control was found; no induced memory pressure or forced app eviction is implemented. Core account daemons and siriactionsd retain their existing critical warnings; feature names alone do not establish safe disabling.

The storage driver advertises NVMe SMART capability, but read-only IOCreatePlugInInterfaceForService returned `0xe00002c7` on this device; lifetime writes/endurance/wear could not be obtained. The Memory & Storage sheet displays data-filesystem capacity, available and used space; unavailable health counters are not guessed. No terabyte-write lifetime or rated endurance is invented.
